Hi 

- This is a beginner expense tracker web application
- I am going to add more feautures over time

- Needs: removal, decimal places, ect...

This project solves a real problem by tracking expenses and persisting data using localStorage. I structured it with small reusable functions, separated logic from UI, and handled DOM updates efficiently.”
